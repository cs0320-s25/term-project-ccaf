# [DRAFT] term-project-ccaf: A Secondhand Fashion Discovery Tool

**Draft** is a secondhand fashion discovery and curation web application. It allows users to explore resale listings across platforms like eBay, Depop, and Poshmark, and save their favorite items into visual "drafts" (moodboards) based on personal style.

This tool is designed for fashion-forward users who want to find unique pieces and build curated looks from the secondhand ecosystem â€” making sustainable fashion stylish and personalized.


## Features

- **Search Resale Listings**: Users can search for clothing items across eBay, Depop, and Poshmark.
- **Moodboard Drafts**: Users create "drafts" â€” visual collections of pieces that reflect a theme, vibe, or style.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Pieces are recommended based on user interactions, saved drafts, and style palettes.
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Clerk for secure user login and identity management.
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase Firestore stores all user data, drafts, and curated pieces.


## Architecture

Draft uses a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- Frontend (React + Clerk)
- Controller (Spark Java HTTP Endpoints)
- Model (Firestore, Recommender Engine, API Fetchers)


- **Frontend**: Built with React, using Clerk for user authentication and Firebase for real-time data.
- **Backend**: Spark Java framework handles routing and JSON endpoints.
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore stores user data, drafts, and individual piece metadata.
- **External APIs**: eBay data is fetched using the Browse API. Depop and Poshmark are scraped via internal scrapers.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests new pieces based on user behavior (e.g., saves, clicks, styles).
